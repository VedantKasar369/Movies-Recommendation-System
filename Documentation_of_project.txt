Movies Recommendation Project
Overview
The Movies Recommendation Project aims to provide users with a list of five movies similar to any given movie. By leveraging content-based filtering techniques, the system recommends movies based on features extracted from the movie metadata.

Audience
This documentation is intended for any user interested in understanding the implementation and working of the Movies Recommendation System.

Data Collection and Preparation
Data Sources
Kaggle: The data for this project was sourced from Kaggle, specifically from the "Movies tmdb" dataset.
Data Description
Movies tmdb Data: The dataset contains various attributes of movies such as movie titles, genres, release year, ratings, and more.
Data Cleaning
Cleaning Steps: Certain columns that were deemed unnecessary for the recommendation system were dropped to streamline the data. This included columns that had missing values or did not contribute significantly to the recommendation process.

The recommendation system implemented is a Content-Based Recommendation System.

Algorithms Used
Cosine Similarity: To find the similarity between movies based on their features.
TF-IDF Vectorization: Used to convert textual data (like movie descriptions) into numerical vectors.
Libraries and Frameworks
scikit-learn: Used for machine learning algorithms and data processing.
Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: Used for numerical operations.
Implementation

Key Functions
clean_data(): Function to clean and preprocess the data.
extract_features(): Function to extract and vectorize features from the data.
recommend_movies(): Function to recommend movies based on the input movie name.
Dependencies
scikit-learn
pandas
numpy

Results and Discussion
Model Performance
The model was able to successfully recommend similar movies based on the movie name provided by the user. The recommendations were evaluated qualitatively by checking the relevance of the recommended movies to the input movie.

Challenges Faced
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and irrelevant columns was a significant challenge.
Feature Extraction: Converting textual data into meaningful numerical vectors required careful consideration of different vectorization techniques.
Deployment
Deployment Method
The recommendation system can be deployed as a web application using strealit. Users can input a movie name, and the system will return five similar movie recommendations.

Tools and Platforms
streamlit: For creating the web application.
Heroku/AWS: For deploying the web application (optional).
Conclusion
Future Work
Enhance Features: Incorporate user ratings and reviews to improve recommendations.
Hybrid Model: Combine content-based and collaborative filtering techniques for better accuracy.
Real-Time Recommendations: Implement real-time data updates to provide up-to-date recommendations.
